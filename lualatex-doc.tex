\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This document is a map, or touristic guide, for the new world of
  \lualatex.\footnote{Though focusing on \lualatex, it includes relevant
    information about \luatex with the Plain format, too.} The intended
  audience ranges from complete newcomers (with a working knowledge of
  conventional \latex) to package developers. This guide is intended to be
  comprehensive in the following sense: it contains pointers to all relevant
  sources, gathers information that is otherwise scattered, and adds
  introductory material.

  Feedback and suggestions for improvement are most welcome.

\section{Essential packages and practices}\label{essential}

This section presents the packages you'll probably want to always load as a
user, or that you should absolutely know about as a developer.

\subsection{User-level}

\pkdesc{fontspec}{\WSPR}{\xetex, \luatex}{\latex}{%
  macros/latex/contrib/fontspec/}[https://github.com/wspr/fontspec/]
Nice interface to font management, well-integrated in to the \latex font
selection scheme. Already presented in the previous section.

\subsection{Developer-level}

\subsubsection{Naming conventions}

On the \tex end, control sequences starting with ©\luatex© are reserved for
primitives. It is strongly recommended that you do \emph{not} define any such
control sequence, to prevent name clashes with future versions of \luatex. If
you want to a emphasize that a macro is specific to \luatex, we recommend that
you use the ©\lua© prefix (without a following ©tex©) instead. It is okay to
use the ©\luatex@© prefix for internal macros, since primitive names never
contain ©@©, but it might be confusing. Moreover, you're already using a
unique prefix for internal macros in all of your packages, aren't you?

On the Lua end, please keep the global namespace as clean as possible. That
is, use a table ©mypackage© and put all your public functions and objects in
this table. You might want to use Lua's \href
{http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-module} {\code{module()}}.
Other strategies for Lua module management are discussed in \href
{http://www.lua.org/pil/15.html} {chapter~15 of \emph{Programming in Lua}}.
Also, it is probably a good idea to use ©local© for your internal variables
and functions. Finally, to avoid clashes with future versions of \luatex, it
is recommended to avoid modifying the namespaces of \luatex's default
libraries.

\subsubsection{Engine and mode detection}\label{detect}

Various packages allow to detect the engine currently processing the document.

\pkdesc{ifluatex}{\HO}{all}{\latex, Plain}{%
  macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/}
Provides ©\ifluatex© and makes sure ©\luatexversion© is available.

\pkdesc{iftex}{\VK}{all}{\latex, Plain}{%
  macros/latex/contrib/iftex/}[http://bitbucket.org/vafa/iftex]
Provides ©\ifPDFTeX©, ©\ifXeTeX©, ©\ifLuaTeX© and corresponding ©\Require©
commands.

\pkdesc{expl3}{The \LaTeX3 Project}{all}{\latex}{%
  macros/latex/contrib/expl3/}[http://www.latex-project.org/code.html]
Amongst \emph{many} other things, provides ©\luatex_if_engine:TF©,
©\xetex_if_engine:TF© and their variants.

\pkdesc{ifpdf}{\HO}{all}{\latex, Plain}{%
  macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/}
Provides ©\ifpdf© switch. \luatex, like \pdftex, can produce either PDF or DVI
output; the later is not very useful with \luatex as it doesn't support any
advanced feature such as Unicode and modern font formats. The ©\ifpdf© switch
is true if and only if you are running \pdftex-or-\luatex in PDF mode (note
that this doesn't include \xetex, whose support for PDF is different).

\subsubsection{Basic resources}

\pkdesc{luatexbase}{\ER \& \MPG}{\luatex}{\latex, Plain}{%
  macros/luatex/generic/luatexbase/}[https://github.com/mpg/luatexbase]
The Plain and \latex formats provide macros to manage \tex basic resources,
such as count or box registers. \luatex introduces new resources that need to
be shared gracefully by packages. This package provides the basic tools to
manage: the extended conventional \tex resources, catcode tables, attributes,
callbacks, Lua modules loading and identification. It also provides basic
tools to handle a few compatibility issues with older version of \luatex.

\note{Warning} This package is currently in conflict with the \pk{luatex}
package, since they both do almost the same thing. The respective package
authors are well aware of this situation and plan to somehow merge the two
packages in the near future, though the timeline is not clear.

\pkdesc{luatex}{\HO}{\luatex}{\latex, Plain}{%
  macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/}
See the description of \pk{luatexbase} above. This package provides the same
core features except for callback management and Lua module identification.

\pkdesc{lualibs}{\ER}{\luatex}{Lua}{%
  macros/luatex/generic/lualibs/}[https://github.com/mpg/lualibs]
Collection of Lua libraries and additions to the standard libraries; mostly
derived from the \context libraries. If you need a basic function that Lua
doesn't provide, check this package before rolling your own implementation.

\subsubsection{Font internals}\label{fontint}

Those packages are loaded by \pk{fontspec} to handle some low-level font and
encoding issues. A normal user should only use \pk{fontspec}, but a developer
may need to know about them.

\pkdesc{luaotfload}{\ER \& \KH}{\luatex}{\latex, Plain}{%
  macros/luatex/generic/luaotfload/}[https://github.com/khaledhosny/luaotfload]
Low-level OpenType font loading. Basically, it uses the ©fontloader© Lua
library and the appropriate callbacks to implement a syntax for the ©\font©
primitive very similar to that of \xetex and implement the corresponding font
features. It also handles a font database for transparent access to fonts from
the system and the \tex distribution either by family name or by file name, as
well as a font cache for faster loading.

\pkdesc{euenc}{\WSPR, \ER \& \KH}{\xetex, \luatex}{\latex}{%
  macros/latex/contrib/euenc/}[https://github.com/wspr/euenc]
Implements the ©EUx© Unicode font encodings for \latex's \pf{fontenc} system.
Currently, \xelatex is using ©EU1© and \luatex is using ©EU2©. Includes
definitions (\file{fd} files) for Latin Modern, the default font loaded by
\pk{fontspec}.

Also includes a stripped version of \pf{xunicode} so that the usual control
sequences for non-ASCII characters (such as ©\'e©) do the right thing.

\section{Other packages}\label{other}

\subsection{User-level}

\pkdesc{luatextra}{\ER \& \MPG}{\luatex}{\latex}{%
  macros/luatex/generic/luatextra/}[https://github.com/mpg/luatextra]
Loads various useful packages such as \pk{luatexbase}, \pk{luaotfload},
\pf{metalogo} (providing the ©\LuaTeX© and ©\LuaLaTeX© commands) and adds a
few goodies, such as a ©luacode© environment.

\pkdesc{luainputenc}{\ER \& \MPG}{\luatex, \xetex, \pdftex}{\latex}{%
  macros/luatex/latex/luainputenc/}[https://github.com/mpg/luainputenc]
Helps compiling documents relying on legacy encodings (either in the source or
with the fonts). Already presented in the introduction. When running \xetex,
just loads \pf{xetex-inputenc}; under \pdftex, loads the standard
\pf{inputenc}.

\pkdesc{luamplib}{\HH, \Taco \& \ER}{\luatex}{\latex, Plain}{%
  macros/luatex/generic/luamplib/}[https://github.com/mpg/luamplib]
Provides a nice interface for the ©mplib© Lua library that embeds metapost in
\luatex.

\pkdesc{luacolor}{\HO}{\luatex}{\latex}{%
  macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/}
Changes low-level color implementation to use \luatex attributes in place of
whatsits. This makes the implementation more robust and fixes strange bugs
such as wrong alignment when ©\color© happens at the beginning of a ©\vbox©.

\pkdesc{luadirections}{\KH}{\luatex}{\latex, Plain, \context}{}
[https://github.com/khaledhosny/luadirections]
Higher-level interface to \luatex's multi-directional support. Currently not
released on CTAN.

\subsection{Developer-level}

\pkdesc{pdftexcmds}{\HO}{\luatex, \pdftex, \xetex}{\latex, Plain}{%
  macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/}
Though \luatex is mostly a superset of \pdftex, a few utility primitives were
removed (those that are sort of superseded by Lua) or renamed. This package
provides them with consistent names across engines, including \xetex which
recently implemented some of these primitives, such as ©\strcmp©.

\pkdesc{magicnum}{\HO}{\luatex, \pdftex, \xetex}{\latex, Plain}{%
  macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/}
Provides hierarchical access to ``magic numbers'' such as catcodes, group
types, etc. used internally by \tex and its successors. Under \luatex, a more
efficient implementation is used and a Lua interface is provided.

\pkdesc{lua-alt-getopt}{Aleksey Cheusov}{\cmd{texlua}}{command-line}{%
  support/lua/lua-alt-getopt}[http://luaforge.net/project/lua_altgetopt]
Command-line option parser, mostly compatible with POSIX and GNU getopt, to be
used in command-line Lua scripts such as \cmd{mkluatexfontdb} from
\pk{luaotfload}.

\section{The \cmd{luatex} and \cmd{lualatex} formats}\label{formats}

\section{Things that Just Work, partially work, or don't work (yet)}
\label{workornot}

\subsection{Just Working}\label{working}

\subsection{Partially working}\label{partial}

\para{microtype}
Package \pf{microtype} has limited support for \luatex: more precisely, as of
version 2.4 2010/01/10, protrusion and expansion are available and activated
by default in PDF mode, but kerning, spacing and tracking are not supported
(sse table~1 in section~3.1 of \file{microtype.pdf}).

On the other hand, \pk{luaotfload}, loaded by \pk{fontspec}, supports a lot of
microtypographic features. So the only problem is the lack of a unified
interface.

\para{xunicode}
Package \pf{xunicode}'s main feature is to ensure that the usual
sequences for non-ASCII characters (such as ©\'e©) do the right thing in a
Unicode context. It could \emph{probably} work with \luatex, but explicitly
checks for \xetex only. Since \pk{euenc}, loaded by \pk{fontspec}, includes a
modified version of this package, you usually don't need \pf{xunicode} so this
is not a problem.

\subsection{Not working (yet)}\label{notworking}
