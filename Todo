- packages related to encodings, like soul, listings & fancyvrb:
get my ideas clear on that matter and rework the correspoding paragraphs.
See mail from Ulrike.

- expand on babel/polyglossia & non-latin languages

- expand stub paragraphs in the formats section

- investigate why " appears always as right quotes in \tt

- investigate missing bold with libertine

- mention luacode ^^

- maybe expand/rework \para{metrics}: (via Stephan)
    - 1st word of a par, font changes are not word boundaries
    - ligatures??? (6.5 of the manual - but does luaotfload change it?)
    - new patterns, unlike old engines
