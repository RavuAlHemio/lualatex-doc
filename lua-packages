ifluatex:       provides \ifluatex (gen, *tex)
ifpdf:          provides \ifpdf (gen, *tex)

luatexbase:     resource management (gen, luatex)
luatex:         resource managment (gen, luatex)
                luatexbase and luatex are to be merged somehow

lualibs:        Lua utility library (lua, luatex)
luatextra:      loads luaextra+luatexbase+luaotfload; goodies (gen, luatex)
xltxtra:        loads basics & fontspec; goodies & patches (ltx, xetex)
                Plan: extend it to luatex, maybe merge luatextra in later.

luainputenc:    input encoding & compat for fontenc (ltx, luatex)
                Plan: add more modes, inc. one without active chars.
luamplib:       mplip user-level support (gen, luatex)

luaotfload:     low-level otf management (gen, luatex)
fontspec:       user-level font management (ltx, xetex, luatex)
microtype:      microtypography (ltx, pdftex, luatex partially)
                Robert working on extending luatex support.
                May partially overlap with luaotfload; yet to be decided.

euenc:          Unicode font encodings (ltx, xetex, luatex)
                Includes a stripped down fork of xunicode:  euxunicode.
xunicode:       convert usual CS like \' to Unicode (?) (ltx, xetex)
                Could be used with luatex, but checks for xetex only.
                Stripped, modified version included in euenc.

luacolor:       Colors via attributes (ltx, luatex)
                luaotfload handle font color, this one is more general
                how do they interact?

luadirections:  Higher-level interface for directions (gen, luatex)

magicnum:       Access constants: group type, etc. (gen, *tex)
                LuaTeX is optional but will be used if present.

pdftexcmds:     Implement pdfTeX primitives in Lua (gen, pdftex, luatex, xetex)
                Very partial support under xetex.

lua_alt-getopt: Option parsing for scripts. (command-line, luatex)

Coming next?

luafontenc:     Support for old font encodings w/o active chars (ltx, luatex)

luatex-def:     luatex.def file for graphics (ltx, luatex)

luaxetex:       emulation of XeTeX primitives (gen, luatex)
                eg: \XeTeXinterchartoks, could be useful for portability?

lualineno:      better implementation of lineno using luatex (ltx, luatex)

soul:           could it use some LuaTeX features? (ltx, luatex)

expl3 support?
